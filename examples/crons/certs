# Renew certs:
#  - avoid dnsec key rolls times 
#    dns_tools uses locking but good to avoid overlap
#    dnssec renews on 2nd of every month at 8 am and rolls 10 am
#  - certs renew (check) every Tue afternoon and roll 2 hours later

# update /create dh parms :
# rfc 7919 pre-defined groups are created once as they don't change
# For older DH params, they will be updates if existing file is older than min age.
# The default min age is 120 days. Use -a to change min age.
# Update early morning ahead of any cert renewal.
