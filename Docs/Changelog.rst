	    update Docs/Changelog.rst Docs/ssl-mgr.pdf


**[4.9.0] ----- 2024-11-27** ::

	    Fix bug with sslm-info not showing IP addresses in SAN
	    update Docs/Changelog.rst Docs/ssl-mgr.pdf


**[4.5.0] ----- 2024-10-21** ::

	     * New config variable : renew_expire_days_spread (default 0)
	       When set to value > 0, renew will happen between expiry_days Â±spread days.
	       Where spread days is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between -spread and spread.
	       Using this keeps the average renewal time the same but with multiple certificates
	       this helps renewals not all fall on same day even if have same expiration.
	    update Docs/Changelog.rst Docs/ssl-mgr.pdf


**[4.4.0] ----- 2024-10-21** ::

	    update Docs/Changelog.rst Docs/ssl-mgr.pdf

**[4.3.0] ----- 2024-08-18** ::

	        New config option *post_copy_cmd*
	           For each server getting copies of certs may run this command on machine on which sslm-mgr is running.
	           The command is passed server hostname as an argument.
	           Usage Example: if a server needs a file permission change for an application user to read private key(s).
	           This option is a list of *[server-host, command]* pairs
	    update Docs/Changelog.rst Docs/ssl-mgr.pdf


**[4.2.0] ----- 2024-08-17** ::

	    X509v3 Extended Key Usage adds "Time Stamping"
	    Changed sslm-dhparm to generate RFC-7919
	       Negotiated Finite Field Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Parameters files - with the default
	       now set to ffdhe8192 instead of ffdhe4096. User options -k overrides the default as usual
	       NB push prod certs to all servers using: sslm-mgr dev -certs-prod
	       NB TLSv1.3 restricts DH key exchange to named groups only.
	    openssl trusted certificates there is ExtraData after the cert
	       which has the trust data. cryptography.x509 will not load this so strip it off.

	    update Docs/Changelog.rst Docs/ssl-mgr.pdf


**[3.1.1] ----- 2024-05-20** ::

	    Seems possible that letsencrypt dns-01 may not always use the apex domain
	        authoritative servers or perhaps their (secondary) check can lag more. At least it seems that way lately.
	        We tackle this with the addition of 2 new variables to the top level config:
	        See README : dns-check-delay and dns_xtra_ns.
	    improve the way nameservers are checked for being up to date with acme challenges.
	        First check the primary has all the acme challenge TXT records. Then check
	        all nameservers, including the *xtra_ns* have the same serial as the primary
	    Code improvements and cleanup in dns module.
	    buglet whereby the cleanup code was incorrectly calling for dns nameserver validation.
