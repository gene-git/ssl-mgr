    """
    Creates the final tlsa for apex domain (group)
    file consisting any nonempty :
      - <svc>/curr/tlsa.rr + <svc>/next/tlsa.rr

    Resuling tlsa file located in certs/apex_domain/tlsa.<apex_domain>
    contains combined tlsa for all services.
    Usually only one <svc> has a tlsa file for this domain
    time stamp should be the 'latest' of any tlsa.rr file
    Its fine to have multiple tlsa records - thats what happens
    during renewal (aka phase 1 roll) where 1 record
    has curr and other uses next

    This combined apex_domain tlsa file is copied to a dns directory
    for the apex_domain zone file, which pulls it into the zone
    file using $INCLUDE.
    During 1st phase of key roll, tlsa needs both curr and
    next tlsa records - this is normal for 'renew'. 2nd roll phase
    (called 'roll') rolls next to be new current and pushes out updates.

    ** Important **
    In order to ensure all tlsa files are kept we include union
    of all services from config file plus command line.
    Otheriwse running 1 service with no tlsa could just
    create empty group level one.
